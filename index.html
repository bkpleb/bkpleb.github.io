    <p>Interested in cryptography, political economy, governance, and financial markets.</p>

    <p>Currently a scribe at <a href="https://www.communitylabs.com/">Community Labs</a> focusing on <a href="https://arweave.org/">Arweave</a> + <a
            href="https://ao.arweave.dev/">AO</a> (never underestimate resource coordination).
    
    <p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
    <p>Systems are fascinating; I enjoy writing about them and exploring their design. <br>Senior in high school, based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

    <p><b>Why web3?</b></p>
    <p>For a variety of reasons, but I've always been into it for the tech. You have trustlessness, self-sovereignty,
    programmable money & privacy.
    
    When the PC was introduced, it was shunned by the world. But Bill Gates had a vision of â€œa computer on every desk, and
    in every home, running Microsoft software". Similarly, I believe everyone will have a wallet and will be using consumer
    crypto apps without the need to know much about crypto.</p>

    <p><b>Aspirations</b></p>
    <p>I love working at startups and wish to keep doing that forever! My long-term vision is to excel at mechanism and market
    design. The more I learn, more I know that I know nothing. Always learning in perpetuity. In my free time, I like to
    read, bushwalk, play <a href="https://ch.tetr.io/u/devargnes">tetr</a>, <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/MzQ1MjU0Mg/AU">birding</a>, and pursue <a href="https://bithiah.notion.site/Hobbies-11036112212c809c93f2d1fed1064a49">many other things</a>.</p>
